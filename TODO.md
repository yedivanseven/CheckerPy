# To Do
- Write tests for parsers!
- Check _*args_ and _**kwargs_ with decorators!
- Update docstring of decorators with _*args_ and _**kwargs_ behaviour.
- Test combining decorators!
- Adapt README!

# To Try
- Add type and bounds inspection for general iterator in decorators with iter()!
- Check what exactly is an iterable that works with map and for!
- Add JustIterator to types?
- Add JustIterable to validators?
- Rename JustIter to JustCollection!
- Factor out setting names and __argnames__ to function_to_decorate!

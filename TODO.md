# To Do
- Add Contains validator to see if an item is in the container that we want to check!

- Add type and bounds inspection for general iterator in decorators with iter()?
- Add JustIterator to types?
- Add JustIterable to validators?
- Rename JustIter to JustCollection or JustContainer?
- Write tests for parsers?

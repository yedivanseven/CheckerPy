# To Do
- Where do we want to show values and where not?
- Make sure that type and bounds specification in decorators is UNsmart!
- Make AllLike weak type checkers and append to validators!
- Write README for JustSize, Has, AllHave, Like, ...

# To Consider
- Add decorator for weak types?
- Add AllTypedDict and AllTypedTuple?
- Add type and bounds inspection for general iterator in decorators with iter()?
- Write tests for parsers?

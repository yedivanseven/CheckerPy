# To Do
- Write docstring and test AllContain!
- Write docstring and test AllIdentifier!
- Make AllLike weak type checkers (and append to validators)!

- Register Like types!
- Check what is registered with what!
  - Adapt tests to reflect this!

# To Consider
- Make set out of things to check for (e.g., in Contains)!
- Add decorator for weak types?
- Add AllTypedDict and AllTypedTuple?
- Add type and bounds inspection for general iterator in decorators with iter()?
- Write tests for parsers?
